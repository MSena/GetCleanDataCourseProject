#Code book

This Code Book contains:

* Information about the summary choices I made;
* Information about the data variables (including units) in the data set provided for the Course;
* Information about the way the data is processed with the run_analysis.R script to deliver a tidy data set as requested.

##Summary (and choices I made)

This project was developed in Rstudio  
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) - running on Windows7 Professional
R version: 3.1.2 (2014-10-31) -- "Pumpkin Helmet"




##The Data Variables 


## The instruction list/script

I created a computer script (in R - run_analysis.R) that takes the raw data as input and produces the tidy data I'm sharing as output (finalTable.txt).
